# React Odin Library

This is a nod to my old [Odin Project Library](https://github.com/ParkerGagliano/OdinProjectLibrary) iteration when I was first learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. More information about the project itself can be found in this repo

This was built using React and Bootstrap. I wanted to create this to have an updated version of my (very bad) first shot at this concept. While this isnt anything too special, making the page more interactive and using a CSS framework to get it done quickly, was fun and I was able to practice using react by reading their new [beta docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) which I heard was the new best way to learn react since its a far better experience. I only read through the 'Thinking in React' section in order to create this. Overall its way clearner javascript wise than my first attempt at this project concept.
